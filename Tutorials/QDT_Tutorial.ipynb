    "\n",

    "\\mathbf{M} = \\left(M_0, M_1, \\dots, M_{n-1}\\right) ,\n",

    "### Quantum Detector Tomography\n",
    "Quantum Detector Tomography/Quantum Measurement Tomography is a procedure aiming to obtain classical description (i.e.,\n",
    "matrix representation) of the POVM implemented in the quantum device [[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys1133). The technique requires preparation of different\n",
    "quantum states and measuring them with the detector (in analogy to different measurement in quantum state tomography).\n",
    "Here the implicit assumptions are stability of detector in time, access to infinite number of experiments and perfect\n",
    "state preparation. The minimal number of distinct experiments required to perform QDT when one uses eigenstates of Pauli\n",
    "operators is $4^K$ ($K$ being the number of qubits). By obtaining POVMs via QDT technique, we can not only properly characterize noisy measurement that is performed by the device, but we can also use this knowledge to mitigate errors in future experiments (see our\n",
    "[Error-Mitigation Tutorial](Error_Mitigation_Tutorial.ipynb)) [[2]](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-04-24-257/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several subroutines of POVMs reconstruction that can be used in QDT. The one we implement is iterative\n",
    "algorithm from from Ref. [3]. The algorithm provably converges to maximum-likelihood estimator and it asserts positivity\n",
    "of operators in each iteration step by use of Lagrange multipliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distances between measurements\n",
    "Having reconstructed (via QDT) noisy POVM $\\mathbf{M}$, we would naturally like to compare it with the ideal detector\n",
    "$\\mathbf{P}$. In order to achieve that, we need some notion of distance between quantum measurements. Distances between\n",
    "POVMs are usually closely related to the distances between probability distributions that they generate via Born's rule.\n",
    "Hence first we will need a measure of distance between probability distributions. The one we choose here is a\n",
    "$\\textbf{Total-Variation Distance}$ defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D_{TV}\\left(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} ||\\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{q}||_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i |p_i-q_i| \\ .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can define $\\textbf{operational distance}$ between quantum measurements:\n",
