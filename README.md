# QREM
**QREM** - **Q**uantum **R**eadout **E**rrors **M**itigation, an open-source package for implementing 
measurement noise characterization and mitigation on quantum devices.

  
## Status of development
This package is under development and new functionalities and notebooks are expected to be added in the future.

Currently, the methods for quantum detector tomography and measurement error mitigation based on that tomography are
working properly (see Ref. [[0]](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-04-24-257/))

Recent update implements ideas from Ref. [[0.5]](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-06-01-464/).
This includes
a) efficient characterization of multiqubit noise correlations via Diagonal Detector Overlapping Tomography (DDOT),
b) using characterization data to construct a noise model which can be used to mitigate errors on the level of marginal probablitiy distributions (for problems such as QAOA).

Soon detailed tutorials will be added. 
  

## Installing 

### Using PIP

The best way to install this package is to use pip (see [pypi website](https://pypi.org/project/QREM/)):
```
pip install QREM
```

This method will automatically install all required dependecies (see [below for list of dependecies](#deps_list)).


### Cloning repository
Alternatively, one can simply clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/fbm2718/QREM
```

Please note that when using this method, one needs to make sure that all imports/dependecies are proper.

## Jupyter tutorials
Most of the functionalities are described in detail in the comments inside the code. However, before starting to use the
package, we recommend to take a look at tutorials in jupyter notebooks:

[(**Quantum Detector Tomography**)](Tutorials/QDT)
1. [Tutorial for implementing Quantum Detector Tomography](Tutorials/QDT/01_implementing_QDT.ipynb)
2. [Tutorial for mitigating readout noise based on QDT](Tutorials/QDT/02_error_mitigation.ipynb)

(**Diagonal Detector Overlapping Tomography**)
1. Tutorials for DDOT will be added soon! In the meantime -- see [examples](examples).
